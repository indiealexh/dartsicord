# dartsicord

This is a basic Dart library intending to provide fundamental functionality to Discord's API.
Many features are missing from this library. It is expandable, so I am open to modification.

Currently, this library is able to process basic text commands and reply accordingly.
This library will go as far as full text functionality but no voice functionality.

## Usage

Examples can/will be found in the example directory.

## Issues

You know where to put them.
