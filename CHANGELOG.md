# Changelog

## 0.0.10

23 Dec 2017

This update focuses mostly on user experience rather than new features. I have recently been on vacation, so I apologize for the few updates! If you haven't already noticed, I'm going to start adding more detail into the CHANGELOG like this short paragraph as well as a date in which the update was released. Additionally, I'm planning on making dartsicord a little more serious than I planned it to be.
